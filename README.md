# Project07 xv6 strace

## About

## Requirements

### Overview

In this project you will get experience using the xv6 systems calls for working with processes in Unix and with making modifcations to the kernel to support a command called `strace`.

The `strace` program is standard on many versions of Unix, including Linux that allows you to see all the system calls that a program invokes during execution. This can be helpful for debugging certain types of problems. It also helps you understand how system calls are used. You can learn more about it here:

https://opensource.com/article/19/10/strace

We are going to modify xv6 to support a simple version of the `strace` command. You will make modifications to the kernel, add an `strace` system call, and write a new user level program called `strace` that will run a program with tracing on.
